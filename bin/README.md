# ActivityDiagramBuilder

in many situations, a project has information assets described in text format, and those assets need to be represented in UML diagrams.
For example, business process analysts may have business process descriptions in text that need to be converted to UML activity diagrams before delivery to the application developers.
It may take a long time and significant effort for business analysts to go through the business process descriptions and create activity diagrams for each business process.

This Eclipse Plugin make use of Rational Modeling Platform API to build Activity Diagram from Pseudo code for IBM Rational Software Modeler (RSM).
